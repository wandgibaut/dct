# Distributed Cognitive Toolkit

The Distributed Cognitive Toolkit (DCT) is a toolkit based primally on shellscript and python (although this can be freely changed) to allow the construction of Distributed Cognitive Architectures, either in the form of containers of in a multi-device fashion.

This project is based on [Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST)](https://github.com/CST-Group/cst) and follows the same theories what CST rellies on.
